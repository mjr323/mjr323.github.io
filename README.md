This line chart looks at the past five years of data for the percentages of students in each undergraduate college at Lehigh. The Y-axis represents the percentage of students and the X-axis is the year. The data for the business school remains about the same all five years, with a slight increase and then decrease in the percentage of students. Arts and sciences sees the biggest increase in percentage of students, with an upward trend throughout all five years. Engineering, however, sees a downward trend and the percentage of students goes through a continual decrease over five years.

This scatterplot looks at self-reported data of life satisfaction compared with GDP per capita. The Y-axis represents life satisfaction and the X-axis is the GDP per capita. Looking at trends in the scatterplot, we can see that as the GDP per capita increases life satisfaction also increases. However, once GDP per capita reaches a certain point, life satisfaction remians high but there is no continuation of an upward trend.
